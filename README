Pod-InComments version  0.9
===========================

Module for embedding POD in the comments of your config file.
With the appropriate routines to extract the whole or parts of it.


E.g., when your config file looks like:

;=head1 cpu
;
;Specifies cpu settings for normal boxes
;note that these will override factory settings!
;
;=head2 maxload
;
;The maxload setting gives an upperbound on how hard
;the CPU can be pushed.

[cpu]
maxload=4.0


then doing:

my $pod = $podparser->Pod4Section( 'cpu', 'maxload' );
will give you:

The maxload setting gives an upperbound on how hard
the CPU can be pushed.
